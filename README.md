# 0x1B. C - Sorting algorithms & Big O

An introductory project on:

-   different sorting algorithms
-   What is the Big O notation, and how to evaluate the time complexity of an algorithm
-   How to select the best sorting algorithm for a given input
-   What is a stable sorting algorithm

## Requirements

-   files should be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`

## File Descriptions

[print_array](https://github.com/Gbeminiyi-S/sorting_algorithms/print_array) - Prints ...

[print_list](https://github.com/Gbeminiyi-S/sorting_algorithms/print_list) - Prints a list of integers

### Mandatory

[0-bubble_sort.c](https://github.com/Gbeminiyi-S/sorting_algorithms/0-bubble_sort.c) - sorts ... in ascending order using the [Bubble sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort) algorithm

-   prints the array after each time you swap two elements

[0-O](https://github.com/Gbeminiyi-S/sorting_algorithms/0-O) - contains the big O notations of the time complexity of the Bubble sort algorithm, with 1 notation per line:

-   in the best case
-   in the average case
-   in the worst case

[1-insertion_sort_list.c](https://github.com/Gbeminiyi-S/sorting_algorithms/1-insertion_sort_list.c) - sorts a doubly linked list of integers in ascending order using the [Insertion sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insertion_sort) algorithm

-   not allowed to modify the integer `n` of a node. You have to swap the nodes themselves
-   prints the list after each time you swap two elements

[1-O](https://github.com/Gbeminiyi-S/sorting_algorithms/1-O) - contains the big O notations of the time complexity of the Insertion sort algorithm, with 1 notation per line:

-   in the best case
-   in the average case
-   in the worst case
